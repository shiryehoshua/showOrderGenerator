This generates a random show order based on the given constraints 
in the file: 
  - No two acts that have the same participants will follow after
    each other
  - Given a time it takes to prepare for an act, and the length
    of each act, every participant will be given enough time to
    prepare for their act

Note: That if there is not order that works, this will just loop
forever.

To run:
$ python showOrderGenerator.py actData.txt

The act data file should be of the form:

TITLE2 duration preptime
participant1
participant2
participant3
...

TITLE2 duration preptime
participant1
participant2
participant3
...

etc.

Note: The title of the act cannot more than one word, and the
duration and preptime should be integers (presumably, number
of minutes).

The output will end with a show order. Since this is a lazy
algorithm, it will keep trying to generate show orders until
it finds one that works. So something like the following should
be expected:

TITLE2
TITLE6
TITLE5
TITLE3
RESTARTING...

TITLE3
TITLE5
RESTARTING...

TITLE1
TITLE2
TITLE3
TITLE4
TITLE5
TITLE6

And so the generated show order is:
TITLE1
TITLE2
TITLE3
TITLE4
TITLE5
TITLE6
